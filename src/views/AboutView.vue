    <p>Kiddies is a trusted South African kids’ clothing brand, founded in 1993.</p>
    <p>Education, Care and Sustainability – our three foundational pillars. These values are what we built our business upon and what we strive towards as our brand continues to further expand in the future.</p>
    <p>We believe in letting kids be kids, but we also keep both parents and children in mind.</p>
    <h3 class="fw-bold display-6">For the parents:</h3>
    <p>We know your little ones are VERY busy, but we also know you always want them to look their cutest. That’s why we always take both functionality & fashion trends into consideration when creating our garments, ensuring we produce the highest quality clothing in our very own timeless, Kiddies style.</p><br>
    <p class="fw-bold display-6">For the kids:</p>
    <p>We also know what is important to your children: unrestricted comfort along with just the right amount of colourful playfulness. This is why we always take an imaginative and fun approach when designing our garments, while guaranteeing comfort with the use of soft, natural fibres.</p>
